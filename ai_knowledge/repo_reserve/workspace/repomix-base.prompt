## GUIDLINES For producing a result
You are an expert at website development. React and Vite and typescript.

You are tasked with following my instructions.

Use the included project instructions as a general guide.

You will respond with only an XML section.
Here are some notes on how you should respond in the XML section:

- Respond with the XML and nothing else
- Include all of the changed files
- Specify each file operation with CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE
- If it is a CREATE or UPDATE include the full file code. Do not get lazy.
- Each file should include a brief change summary.
- Include the full file path
- I am going to copy/paste that entire XML section into a parser to automatically apply the changes you made, so put the XML block inside a markdown codeblock.
- Make sure to enclose the code with ![CDATA[__CODE HERE__]]

Here is how you should structure the XML:

<code_changes>
<changed_files>
<file>
<file_summary>**BRIEF CHANGE SUMMARY HERE**</file_summary>
<file_operation>**FILE OPERATION HERE**</file_operation>
<file_path>**FILE PATH HERE**</file_path>
<file_code><![CDATA[
__FULL FILE CODE HERE__
]]></file_code>
</file>
**REMAINING FILES HERE**
</changed_files>
</code_changes>

So the XML section will be:

```xml
__XML HERE__
```

# Vite/TypeScript Project Guidelines

## Overview
This is a Vite project template.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Vite 15+
- Language: TypeScript, React 19

- Styling: Tailwind CSS V4
- Testing: Jest and React Testing Library
- Package Manager: pnpm

## Rules
Follow these rules when building the project.

### General Rules
- Use absolute imports for anything within the project unless otherwise specified
- Use PascalCase for components and camelCase for functions/variables
- Dont update third-party libraries unless otherwise specified
- Write components and functions with JSDoc documentation
- Aim for roughly 30 lines of code per component/function
- Keep logic and operators simple and pleasant to read
- Use TypeScript types/interfaces for all components, functions, and methods
- Use Vite API routes for building APIs

### Directory Structure
Follow the Vite app directory 

### Environment Rules
- If you update environment variables, update the `.env.example` file
- All environment variables should go in `.env.local` for local development
- Do not expose sensitive environment variables
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side environment variables
- Use `APP_` prefix for server-side environment variables
