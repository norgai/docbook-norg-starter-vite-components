# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Component Starter Kit

## Project Overview

### Vision
Create an intelligent component library starter kit that enables developers to build, display, refine, and interact with React components through AI-powered conversations. The system will feature a live component showcase with the ability to modify components in real-time through natural language interactions.

### Core Value Proposition
- Accelerate component development with AI assistance
- Enable non-technical stakeholders to request component changes directly
- Provide a living documentation system where components can self-modify
- Create a bridge between design requirements and implementation through conversational UI

## Key Features

### 1. Component Showcase System
- Display multiple components and their refined versions on a single page
- Support for theme-based organization (e.g., conversion themes, marketing themes)
- Live preview of components with hot module replacement
- Responsive design support with Tailwind CSS v4

### 2. AI-Powered Component Chat Interface
- Embed a chat interface for each component
- Allow users to request modifications in natural language
- Display conversation history and applied changes
- Support for both text and image inputs (design screenshots)

### 3. N8N Workflow Integration
- Create N8N workflows that receive component modification requests
- Process natural language inputs and translate to code changes
- Trigger Claude Code CLI on the same machine
- Return updated component code to the frontend

### 4. Claude Code Integration Layer
- Develop a secure API layer to interface with Claude Code
- Implement proper authentication and rate limiting
- Queue management for multiple simultaneous requests
- Error handling and rollback capabilities

### 5. Component Version Management
- Track component modifications and versions
- Allow reverting to previous versions
- Display change history with explanations
- Support for branching component variations

### 6. AI Knowledge System
- Utilize existing AI knowledge prompts for component building
- Support multi-step workflows (create, review, refine)
- Image analysis for design-to-code conversion
- Font and styling consistency checks

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Architecture
- React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- Vite build system with SWC
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Component isolation and sandboxing

### Backend Requirements
- N8N workflow server
- Node.js API server for Claude Code integration
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- File system access for code modifications
- Git integration for version control

### AI Integration
- Claude Code CLI wrapper service
- Prompt engineering for component modifications
- Context management for multi-turn conversations
- Image processing for design inputs

### Security Considerations
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting per user/session
- Audit logging of all modifications
- Restricted file system access

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want to quickly scaffold new components using AI assistance
- I want to see live previews of components as they're modified
- I want to maintain version history of component changes
- I want to export components for use in other projects

### As a Designer
- I want to upload design screenshots and see them converted to components
- I want to request styling changes using natural language
- I want to see multiple variations of a component side by side
- I want to ensure design consistency across components

### As a Product Manager
- I want to request functionality changes without writing code
- I want to see the impact of changes immediately
- I want to track who requested what changes and when
- I want to revert changes that don't meet requirements

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Component Display System
- Improve the existing component showcase
- Add component metadata and documentation
- Implement component search and filtering
- Create a component detail view with code display

### Phase 2: Basic Chat Interface
- Add chat UI to component detail pages
- Implement message history storage
- Create mock responses for testing
- Design the conversation flow

### Phase 3: N8N Workflow Development
- Set up N8N server and workflows
- Create webhook endpoints for chat messages
- Implement basic text processing nodes
- Add Claude API integration nodes

### Phase 4: Claude Code Integration
- Develop secure wrapper for Claude Code CLI
- Implement file modification system
- Add git commit automation
- Create rollback mechanisms

### Phase 5: Real-time Updates
- Implement WebSocket connections
- Add live code updates to frontend
- Create progress indicators for AI processing
- Handle concurrent modification requests

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- Add image upload and processing
- Implement component versioning UI
- Create component export functionality
- Add collaborative features

## Success Metrics
- Time reduction in component development (target: 50%)
- Number of successful AI-driven modifications per day
- User satisfaction scores from developers and designers
- Component reuse rate across projects
- Average time from request to implementation

## Technical Constraints
- Must work within the existing Vite/React architecture
- Should not require additional dependencies beyond current stack
- Must maintain sub-second response times for UI interactions
- AI processing should complete within 30 seconds
- Must support concurrent users without conflicts

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-language component generation
- Integration with design tools (Figma API)
- Automated testing generation
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Accessibility compliance checking
- Component marketplace features
